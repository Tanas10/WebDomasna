      <h2>Imagine Dragons</h2>
      <span>Formed in 2009, Imagine Dragons first revealed their limitless passion and genre-bending sensibilities with a series of independently released EPs that quickly earned a grassroots following. After hitmaking producer Alex Da Kid signed them to KIDinaKORNER/Interscope, the band made their major-label debut with Continued Silence, a 2012 EP featuring the double-platinum breakthrough single “It’s Time.” </span>

      <h2>Balkan Folklore Festival</h2>
<span>Balkan Folklore Festival is an international festival of folk songs and dances held in Ohrid from 6th to 11th of July. The festival has a long tradition, which means it was established in 1962. It is a member of two UNESCO’s associations, CIOFF or the International Council of Organizations of Folklore Festivals and Folk Arts and IOFA or International Organization of Folk Art. At the beginning was just a festival of non-professional Folk Ensembles but since 1967, the concept of the festival has changed.</span>      <br>
